# Logic Gates Learning: Majority Gate and Beyond

## ✅ What We Achieved

You implemented a **Majority Gate** using **AND, OR, and NOT gates** after learning logic gates and truth tables for the first time!

This shows:
- Understanding of **combinational logic**
- Applying **truth tables to real circuits**
- Decomposing **non-basic gates into primitives**
- Great **problem-solving skills**

---

## 📘 Recap: What is a Majority Gate?

A **Majority Gate** outputs `1` if at least **two of its three inputs are `1`**.

### Truth Table

| A | B | C | Out |
|---|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  0  |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  1  |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  1  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  1  |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  1  |

### Implementation using AND and OR:
```
Out = (A AND B) OR (A AND C) OR (B AND C)
```

## 🏗️ Homework Mini-Project: Build a Full Adder

### What is a Full Adder?

A **Full Adder** takes:
- A
- B
- Carry In (Cin)

And outputs:
- Sum
- Carry Out (Cout)

### Truth Table

| A | B | Cin | Sum | Cout |
|---|---|-----|-----|------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |  0   |
| 0 | 0 |  1  |  1  |  0   |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |  0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |  0  |  1   |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |  0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |  0  |  1   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |  0  |  1   |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |  1   |

### Task:
✅ Create the truth table  
✅ Find Boolean expressions for `Sum` and `Cout`  
✅ Build using AND, OR, NOT gates  
✅ Draw the circuit  
✅ Simulate it in an online simulator
